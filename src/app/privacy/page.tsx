              <p>Frame Hub collects minimal data necessary to operate the Service:</p>
              <ul className="mt-2 list-inside list-disc space-y-1">
                <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> If you sign in via Google OAuth or email/password, we store your name, email address, and profile picture (when provided). Passwords are stored as one-way hashes, not plain text. You may also set a public username, bio, and custom avatar image.</li>
                <li><strong>Build Data:</strong> Weapon, warframe, companion, modular, archwing, and railjack builds you save to the cloud are stored in our database, linked to your account. Public builds and upvote activity may be visible to other users.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Profile Data:</strong> If you set a username, bio, avatar, or publish builds, that information may be visible on your public profile page and in community features such as Discover. Your email address is not displayed on public profile pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Issue Reports:</strong> If you submit a data report, we store the details you provide (item name, issue flags, comments, and optional reporter name). Reports may be linked to your account when you are signed in.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> If you use Frame Hub without signing in, builds and loadouts may be stored in your browser&apos;s local storage. We do not have access to this data.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> We may temporarily process IP addresses and request metadata for rate limiting, abuse prevention, and security (for example, limiting report submissions).</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">3. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
              <p>
                Frame Hub uses session cookies for authentication and browser local storage for saving builds and
                loadouts offline. We do not use tracking cookies or third-party analytics services.

              <h2 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">4. Data Retention</h2>
              <p>
                Your account and build data are retained as long as your account is active.
                You can delete individual builds from your profile page at any time and remove your custom avatar
                from profile settings. Issue reports are retained so staff can track corrections and follow up when needed.
                If you wish to delete your entire account, please contact us via the Report Issue page.

              <h2 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">5. Data Security</h2>
              <p>
                We use industry-standard security measures including encrypted connections (HTTPS)
                and secure authentication via OAuth 2.0. However, no method of electronic transmission
                or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

              <h2 className="mb-2 text-lg font-semibold text-foreground">6. Third-Party Services</h2>
              <p>
                Frame Hub uses Google OAuth and optional email/password authentication. Google sign-in is subject to
                Google&apos;s Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We only receive the profile information
                you authorize Google to share with us. Optional donations through Buy Me a Coffee are handled by
                Buy Me a Coffee under their own terms and privacy policies; we do not receive your payment credentials.
                If your donation email matches your verified Frame Hub account, we may display a cosmetic Supporter
                badge on your profile.
